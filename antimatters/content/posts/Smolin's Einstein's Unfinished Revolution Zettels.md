title:: **Bohr's complementarity principle as a form of kantian neo-idealism**

  + Bohr's position is reminiscent of Kant's inaccessibility of the "object in itself". We cannot access the ultimate nature of quantum objects but can only construct representations of them. And what we observe is the response of our instruments, never the object itself. #To investigate: the question of neo-Kantianism in modern quantum.

  + [^1]: _“Bohr called the new philosophy complementarity. Here is how he talked about it: Neither particles nor waves are attributes of nature. They are no more than ideas in our minds, which we impose on the natural world. They are useful as intuitive pictures that we construct from observing large-scale objects such as marbles and water waves. Electrons are neither. Electrons are microscopic entities that we cannot observe directly, and so we have no intuition about them. To study electrons we must construct big experimental devices to interact with them. What we observe is never the electron itself; it is only the responses of our big experimental devices to the tiny, invisible electrons.” P. 135_

  + [^2]: _“Bohr talked about the complementarity between life and physics, between energy and causation, and, indeed, between knowledge and wisdom.” P. 136_

title:: **A theory is a description of reality, one that defines a possible image of that reality by providing snapshots of it. It is not a model of reality**
tags:: reality, measurement, quantum theory
folgezettel:: {2th1}

category:: Zettelkasten

  + While we postulate a unique reality, apart from our measurement and observation, we can only access and describe part of it. A scientific theory is a discourse about the reality, equivalent to a natural language description but using a mathematical language, able to provide a model for predictions. If the theory provides good predictions, in tune with experimental measurements, we say it's a true theory. But we fail to realise that we create "a snapshot" of reality by observing it. While most theories can describe time evolution, their basic truths are time-independent, description of instants.

What the theory analizes are these snapshots, and not the reality; i.e. the results of our measurements, not the objects we measure. We then extrapolate the variables to the objects themselves (like mass, speed etc) and try to predict their evolution.

In this sense it is only natural that what we call "wave function" collapses when we measure the quantum object. The data we gather is like a picture on a photographic plate, a snapshot of the situation as our instruments can "see it", it's not actually what the observed object was doing. The wave function is not an intrinsic property of the quantum object, but an extrinsic theoretical property. (Think "Entropy", this is not something our senses can directly perceive, nor something producing direct effects for our senses. It's an extrinsic theoretical property)

  + There is also the observation (below) made by Smolin that quantum states are the information we have about the system, not the physical system.

  + [^1]: “Even if physics is not in general comprehensible as information processing, it may be asserted that the quantum state represents not the physical 
system, but the information we have about the system. ” p.111 (cap 12, p. 216 în versiunea română)
