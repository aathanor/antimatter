While physics was my first love, it took me almost 30 years to understand that philosophy is the real one. I reached the national level of “Olimpiada de fizică” a couple of times in high school in the 80s. I entered the Faculty of Physics in Măgurele in 1985. I wanted to understand how the world is made. In 1989 I started to specialize in the theory of nonlinear systems, while working with a research team developing nuclear fusion experiments (in a remarkable, for its time, mini-"tokamak"). My probable research career ended suddenly in the aftermath of the 1990 Revolution, when many good scientists and teachers fled to western universities and research centers, and I decided to take the new option: business. I left school in 1990 and finished my studies in 2000, without passing the licensing exam, before moving to France.

Since 1990 I and have worked in big companies and started my own: an advertising agency, one of the first online internet TV's in Romania, a heirloom tomato farm and, the last one, Athanor La Coupteur, a restaurant; physics became a distant memory, difficult to tell apart from a dream. This eclectic career told everybody, apart myself, that I didn't found my calling.

This realisation came late when, a few years ago, I was going through old notes when and seen that since 20 years ago I had made many mentions and short notes around the idea of “reality”. I understood that while I had chosen physics as my vocation, what really interested me was the nature of what we call “reality”; how do we know what is real from what we think is real? Isn’t reality something more in my brain than in the world? I began reading Kant and Schopenhauer, with forays into the writings of all the great philosophers who touched on the subject. I soon found myself in a maze of notes and books and realised that I had to study properly. But first I had to finish what I’d started. So in 2023, 33 years after I have abandoned my studies, after more than half a year of studying almost all the disciplines I learned 35 years ago, I took the license exam at the Faculty of Physics. It was strange and truly difficult, but also enlightening. I understood physics as I never could have in my youth. I realised that my vocation is philosophy, not physics. Learning classical1 and quantum mechanics at an older age gives you a new perspective. You understand that mathematical formalism (which easily fascinates a young mind) is just formalism and, to a certain extent, an arbitrary language. You can see how ideas and concepts relate to each other; you can focus on meaning, not results; you can see the forest for the trees. It was clear to me that my interest was in meaning, not in results. This is not what a good scientist does. But it’s essential for a philosopher.

This autumn (2024) I will start Master Degree in Analytics Philosophy, so that my quest for the nature of reality will be a formal one. Better understand how to think like those you disagree with, before telling them that they're not right :)
